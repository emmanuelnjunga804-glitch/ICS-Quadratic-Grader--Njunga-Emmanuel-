# ICS-Quadratic-Grader--Njunga-Emmanuel-
This project features two main tools: a Grading System for managing and calculating student results, and a Quadratic Equation Solver for solving mathematical equations. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# How to Run
1.Download 'index.html' from this repostory
2.Double-click the file to open it in any web browser
3.The application works completely offline,no internet connections required
4.Use the two tools in the web page:
-Quadratic Equation solver(top section)
-Grade Calculator(bottom section)


# Quadratic Equation solver Test Cases
case 1: a=1,b=3,c=2 -  Two distinct real roots: 2 and 1
case 2: a=1,b=2,c=1 - one repeated real root: -1
case 3: a=1,b=1,c=1 - Two complex Conjugate roots
case 4: a=2,b=-4,c=-6 - Two dinstict real roots: 3 and -1

# Grading Calculator Test Cases
85-100 : 85=A+,90=A+,100=A+
75-84: 75=A,80=A,84=A
65-74: 65=B+70=B+74=B+
60-64: 60=B,62=B,64=B
55-54: 50=C+,52=C+,54=C+
0-49: 0=D,25=D,49=D
